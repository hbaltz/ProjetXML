# How to proceed?

Here, I will explain to you how to proceed to use the XML, the XSD and the XSL files that I created to transform the XML file into a KML file

## Check if the XML and the XSD are well-formed

To see if the XML and the XSD are well-formed, you can use an online validator, for exemple [Utilities-online XSD Validation](http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation/), where you can paste the content of tsi2016Final.xml in the xml part and the content of tsi2016Final.xsd in the xsd part. There you check the validity of the files by clikcing on the buttons.

(If you don't want to do the copy/paste you can click [Here](http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation/?save=93f11b28-8f73-40f6-a983-c1bffa8fbe07-xsdvalidation) )

## Validate the XML against the XSD

Using the same tool, you can check if the XML files foollows the schema defines in the XSD file, using the button "Validate XML against XSD", you can evidently use your favorite tool to do validate the XML.

## Check if the XSL is well-formed

It is like for the XML and XSd files, you can use an online validator, for exemple [Utilities-online XSLT Transformation](http://www.utilities-online.info/xsltransformation), where you can paste the content of tsi2016Final.xml in the xml part and the content of tsi2016Final.xsl in the xsdl part. There you check the validity of the files by clikcing on the buttons.

## Open KML on google Earth

* Install [Google Earth](https://www.google.fr/intl/fr/earth/)
